## Don't Only Repost 🚫

Two steps you should follow whenever you come across a knowledgeable content and you want to repost:

**a) Add comments over original post:**  
When you look at a post, add your thoughts into the comment section. This way you engage with the author's audience or something we call *X-factor audience*.

**b) Repost with thoughts:**  
Don't just repost, your connections don't really know the author, they know *you*. Become a source of information, and if you add your own thoughts and then repost, your connections can connect more with you.

## Having a Professional Photo 🧑‍💼

In the era of AI, what really matters is the *feel of human*.  
Add a professional photo where your face is clearly visible & **don’t keep the photo private** to your connections. This means you're not open to new connections — and if in case you're not, then I’m wondering why even you're on a social platform. 😅
